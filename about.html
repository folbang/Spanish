                  <p> 1952 McCarran-Walter Act had led to and legislature action with this law which provided 214,000 visas to refugees, that were mostly in europe. But with 5,000 designated for the far east. This is a program that was designed to aid those fleeing the soviet union, easteern Germany. The communist expansion in Europe was set to expire in 1956. In the of the present there were many visas inteded for europeans that were not allocated becuase many areas had recovered more swiftly than expected. If to reciceve a refugee visa, you have to verify their political history and loss of safe home.  A system of UNRRA and the International Relief Organization which have been primarly concerned with millions of unprooted, homeless, and destitute victims. A living in refugee camps or in the crowded slums of Germany. 

''Refugee'' means any person in a country or area which is neither Communist nor Communist-dominated, who because of persecution, fear of persecution, natural calamity or military operations is out of his usual place of abode and unable to return thereto, who has not been firmly resettled, and who is in urgent need of assistance for the essentials of life or for transportation.
